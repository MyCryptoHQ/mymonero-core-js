# xmr-core

Forked from mymonero/mymonero-core-js, this library provides a few significant changes compared to its origin:

-   Full typescript support
-   Hardware wallet (Ledeger Nano S) support
-   Re-written to es6+ standards
-   Isomorphic, ideal for both server and browser usage

## What's in This Repo?

This mono-repository contains various packages for Monero/CryptoNote cryptography and protocols.
Below you'll find each package and its purpose.

## Features

-   `xmr-address-utils` Utilities for working with Monero addresses
-   `xmr-b58` xmr-b58 contains functions to encode and decode base58 strings for monero operations
-   `xmr-cli` xmr-cli contains basic user operations that use the mono-repo packages for its functionality
-   `xmr-constants` xmr-constants contains constant declarations for working with Monero, such as address prefixes, blocktimes, and decimal places
-   `xmr-crypto-ops` Core crypto operations for Monero
-   `xmr-device` Implementations and interfaces of various hardware devices for creating Monero transactions securely
-   `xmr-fast-hash` An implementation of Monero's `cn_fast_hash`
-   `xmr-key-utils` A collection of functions for creating and verifying Monero related public/private keys.
-   `xmr-keyimg-memoized` Memoized key image generation library
-   `xmr-money` Helpers for formatting and parsing Moneroj.
-   `xmr-mymonero-libs` A collection of utilities for building ontop of a MyMonero compatible API
-   `xmr-nettype-address-prefixes` Helper library to get Monero address prefixes depending on the network type (mainnet|testnet|stagenet)
-   `xmr-pid` Validate, create, and manipulate, Monero payment ids
-   `xmr-rand` Create random hex strings for Monero operations
-   `xmr-str-utils` A library for working with strings commonly used in other Monero libraries
-   `xmr-transaction` Create Monero transactions and check their status
-   `xmr-types` A pure types library that contains shared interfaces and types for the xmr-core mono-repo
-   `xmr-varint` Create varints from numbers and strings for usage in Monero's data structures
-   `xmr-vendor` A container library that holds external dependencies that have been modified for usage in Monero transaction creation / validation

## Usage

The most common use case would be under the domain of a wallet service implementing xmr support. To see basic examples on how this would be done, take a look at the `xmr-cli` package to do basic operations such as sending currency and checking a users balance.
